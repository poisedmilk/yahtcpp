## Generating Doxygen Documentation

To generate the html and latex documentation for this project, cd into the source directory and generate a new Doxyconfig file if it doesn't exist already using:

`doxygen -g`

which will create a default Doxygen config file called `Doxyfile`. Then, you can generate the documentation by doing:

`doxygen Doxyfile`

To help create formatted Doxygen comment blocks in this project, a visual studio plugin was used. Information on the plugin may be found here:
